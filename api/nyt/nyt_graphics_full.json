The court rejected the validity of four appointments President Obama made in January 2012, when the question of whether the Senate was in recess was in dispute. While on the surface the ruling was a blow to executive power, on a deeper level it was also a victory for executive power because it rolled back an appeals court ruling that had gone much further in restricting such authority.",

Sometime in mid-June of 2003, the first known talk of Valerie Wilson's identity as a C.I.A. operative occurred between an official and a journalist. Bob Woodward of The Washington Post came forward as the journalist, but who was his source? Among those who may have been in a position to know about Ms. Wilson, there are plenty of denials -- some of them shown below -- and others who haven't denied involvement, at right.  ",

So far, however, it has not nearly approached the scale of an earlier White House scandal, Iran-contra, and its 11 convictions. The sweep of the Watergate scandal is in a class by itself. Since then, special prosecutors have taken aim at people tied to government's highest offices more than 20 times. Some inquiries, months or years long and costing millions, have found nothing to prosecute. Ronald Reagan's labor secretary, Raymond J. Donovan, was investigated for allegations of mob ties; Reagan's attorney general, Edwin Meese III, was accused of financial improprieties. Neither was indicted. After six years, prosecutors could not prove that Bill and Hillary Clinton's Whitewater real estate venture involved any criminal behavior or attempt to conceal evidence.  ",

    "description": "Wheelchair tennis makes its competitive debut at the United States Open today. While the rules are similar to the ones used by able-bodied athletes, wheelchair players are allowed two bounces. Esther Vergeer of the Netherlands demonstrates the style and strategy of play.  By BEDEL SAGET    STRAPS  Over the feet, femur, hips and waist allow the chair and player to move as one.    ANGLED WHEELS  For increased speed, stability and turning    ANTI-TOP CASTORS  Improve balance and allow the athlete to push his or her weight forward or backward without tipping over.    Mobility Is Key  Players with the greater mobility usually have the edge, and most use patterns to simulate the lateral movement that the chair does not provide them. Vergeer explains some patterns and techniques used for the forehand and the backhand.    THE FOREHAND    THE APPROACH -- Using both hands, Vergeer moves towards the ball. To hit the ball, the racket starts low and ends over her left shoulder. To follow through on the shot, she pulls on the left wheel, which swings her body and chair through the shot.    THE RECOVERY -- Vergeer quickly circles back to the hub, turning her back to the net in the process.    THE BACKHAND    THE APPROACH -- When making contact, she stops the chair with her left hand and keeps herself parallel to the baseline.    THE RECOVERY -- Again she circles back into position at the hub.",
